The first part of the program is the expression manager. When the program starts, the user is prompted to enter an equation ![p1](https://github.com/IsaOrtiz08/CS303_proj3/assets/113536391/16f75840-a49d-4683-91a0-d56c64f6b3aa) This first example has no parenthesis, therefore it passes the balanced parenthesis check and outputs the postfix equation ![p2](https://github.com/IsaOrtiz08/CS303_proj3/assets/113536391/1530cc14-beb0-4638-8f17-42851bbc2a2d) an example of an equation with parenthesis will output as follows ![p4](https://github.com/IsaOrtiz08/CS303_proj3/assets/113536391/869f8bb9-ace5-4d1d-9d8d-696793de99b3)
Should the equation not pass the balanced parenthesis check, the program will output the error message![p5](https://github.com/IsaOrtiz08/CS303_proj3/assets/113536391/408df9c1-2cd2-4ac1-a543-13b7bc1d42ad)

For the Queue class, there is no user input only implementations from within the code. The code is tested by pushing the values 3, 4, 5,and 6 to the queue in that order. The program then outputs the result of pop_front(), and afterward the result of size()

The program then tests the output of front(), isempty() and then once again the result of isempty() after utilizing pop_front() 3 times to clear the queue.
